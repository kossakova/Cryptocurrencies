In supervised learning, first a model is initiated, or a template for the algorithm is created. Then it will analyze the data and attempt to learn patterns, which is also called fitting and training. After the data has been fit and trained, it will then make predictions.

In supervised learning, the input data already has a paired outcome, which is plugged in to train the model to predict outcomes in new datasets. For example, we want to build a model that, when given unfamiliar data, can accurately predict the outcomes.
